# Mediator Pattern

## Overview

The Mediator pattern defines how a set of objects interact with each other. Instead of objects communicating directly, they communicate through a central mediator object. This promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

## Structure

- **Mediator**: Interface that defines the communication contract between components
- **ConcreteMediator**: Implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between components
- **Components**: Individual objects that communicate through the mediator instead of directly with each other

## Key Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: Components don't depend on concrete classes of other components
- **Centralized Control**: All interaction logic is centralized in the mediator
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts with different mediators
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component focuses on its core functionality

## Example

In this implementation, we have an `AuthenticationDialog` that mediates between various UI components:
- Checkbox for switching between login/registration modes
- Textboxes for user input
- Buttons for actions

All components communicate through the dialog mediator instead of directly with each other.

## Usage

```typescript
const dialog = new AuthenticationDialog();

// Components communicate through the mediator
dialog.getLoginOrRegisterCheckbox().check(); // Switches mode
dialog.getLoginUsername().setText('user');   // Sets username
dialog.getOkButton().click();                // Triggers login/registration
```

## When to Use

- When a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways
- When reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
- When behavior distributed between several classes should be customizable without subclassing
